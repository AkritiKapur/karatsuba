# Karatsuba
The program is the implementation of the karatsuba algorithm to multiply two numbers.

### Setup
This is optional but recommended.

To setup a virtualenv
Run `virtualenv venv`

To activate the environment
run `source venv/bin/activate`

### Install dependencies
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all the dependencies required for the project.


### Run the program

Run `python karatsuba.py {num1} {num2} {base}`

Where num1 and num2 are the two numbers you want to multiply
base is the base in which numbers are present and the base in which the product will be displayed.
